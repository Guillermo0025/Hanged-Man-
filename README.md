# Hanged-Man-
this is the hangman game

we have three files in this repository, the first is hangman.py, that is the main program where we will be able to play the game, second, we have
the hung_up_man.py program, where we will be able to see the graphic part that the hangman.py file uses, and last but not least we have the words.py
program, where we will have the "database" of words, from this file the computer will be able to choose randomly one of a thousand words so the
user can try to guess it.
